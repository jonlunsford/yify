        Stranger Than Fiction","review_text":"\nWe all remember Chuck Barris as the
        creator of some of television\u0027s most successful - albeit notoriously
        mind-numbing - game shows: `The Dating Game,\u0027 `The Newlywed Game,\u0027
        and `The Gong Show.\u0027  But did you know that he was also a hit man for
        the CIA?  Well, that\u0027s what he claims, straight from his own `unauthorized
        autobiography\u0027 entitled `Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\u0027 which
        has now been made into a movie by director George Clooney and writer Charlie
        Kaufman.  Kaufman is known for devising elaborately absurd scenarios for his
        fictional films (`Being John Malkovich,\u0027 `Adaptation\u0027 etc.), yet
        even Kaufman, in his wildest fantasies, could not have come up with a more
        bizarre premise than the one this real life story affords.  No wonder he was
        drawn to this material.  They are a perfect fit.  In the world of movies,
        who says fact isn\u0027t stranger than fiction?\n\nIn many ways, Barris was
        one of the men responsible for starting the trend towards `reality television\u0027
        that so dominates network programming today.  His most famous hits (especially
        `The Gong Show\u0027) were all based on the premise that millions of Americans
        would be willing to humiliate themselves in public for a few moments of fleeting
        fame \u0096 and that millions more would tune in to bear witness to the spectacle.  Barris,
        craving fame himself, was simply savvy enough to plug into that national mood
        - and managed to make himself a fortune and turn himself into a household
        name in the process.  What most of us didn\u0027t know about Barris at the
        time was that, while all this was going on, he was ostensibly leading a double
        life as a secret agent, tracking down and killing any number of `bad guys,\u0027
        all in the name of `national security.\u0027\n\nGiven the inherently incredible,
        jaw-dropping nature of the material, George Clooney, in his directorial debut,
        brings an appropriately surrealistic tone to the work.  He employs a number
        of visual devices that help to fragment the world in which the story takes
        place.  Certain scenes break through the constraints of time and space, as
        when Barris is talking on the phone in his apartment to an ABC executive,
        who is sitting in his office, and the two locations become one on the screen.  The
        sense of dislocation this technique creates perfectly reflects the mental
        split occurring in Barris\u0027 own disturbed psyche.  This style is further
        enhanced by the use of slightly off-kilter camera angles, color filtering
        and sepia tones in some of the shots.  Scenarist Charlie Kaufman, as always,
        brings his own quirky vision to bear on the material.  He cleverly balances
        the two `sides\u0027 of Barris\u0027 life, transitioning smoothly between
        those scenes revolving around his career as TV show producer and those revolving
        around his career as CIA operative.  Moreover, Kaufman does a nice job getting
        inside the head of this man who is trying to fight the demons of his own past,
        make a name for himself in the high stakes world of network programming, cope
        with his own inadequacies as a person, and come to terms with the vile things
        he is doing in his secret life all at the same time. \n\nAs Barris, Sam Rockwell
        gives a terrific, high-energy performance, capturing the sadness and paranoia
        of a man who seems to know deep down inside that his fame is probably undeserved,
        built as it is on mediocre ideas and a willingness to exploit the baser instincts
        of human nature.  Drew Barrymore brings her usual charm to the role of Penny,
        Barris\u0027 one true love and the only person genuinely drawn to Barris as
        a person, even though he is unable to commit himself to her fully, preferring
        instead to keep the relationship `casual\u0027 and uncommitted.  Barris finds
        it impossible to make a real, meaningful connection to another human being,
        so twisted has he become in his value system and bizarre lifestyle.  Rounding
        out the cast are Clooney himself, as the mysterious CIA agent who draws Barris
        into this strange netherworld of intrigue and danger, Rutger Hauer, as a fellow
        hit man who pours out his feelings about his chosen occupation to Barris,
        Julia Roberts, as the icy cool CIA operative who pops up at various moments
        and in various places to keep an eye on the young recruit, and even Brad Pitt
        and Matt Damon, who show up for a truly hilarious cameo appearance together,
        one that had the audience at the screening I attended howling with delight.\n\nThe
        $64,000 question becomes, of course, is this story even remotely true, or
        is it merely another case of this master showman\u0027s playing the public
        for all its worth?  I haven\u0027t the slightest idea.  The filmmakers certainly
        take it all very seriously, as evidenced by the fact that they have various
        friends and business acquaintances of Barris (Dick Clark, Jay P. Morgan) providing
        interviews for the film, interviews which hint at the dark possibility that
        the basis of the story might indeed be factual, given the kind of person these
        people claim Barris is.  This gives the film a kind of pseudo-documentary
        realism that heightens the verisimilitude of what we are seeing on screen.  Whether
        the film is really a true story or merely a grand lark perpetrated on an increasingly
        credulous audience, the fact is that `Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\u0027
        turns out to be a thoroughly entertaining, utterly loony piece of original
        filmmaking.\n\n`Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\u0027 marks an auspicious
        debut for Clooney as a director, who, in his work behind the camera, demonstrates
        a thorough command of vision and style.  One looks forward to his next endeavor.

        Anglia, UK","review_summary":"A highly disarming dark comedy","review_text":"One
        of Charlie Kaufman\u0027s more overlooked and underrated screenplays, \u0027Confessions
        of a Dangerous Mind\u0027 may have been something of a departure from the
        high-concept experimentalism that made his previous brainchildren, \u0027Being
        John Malkovich\u0027 and \u0027Adaptation\u0027 (a masterpiece and a near-masterpiece,
        respectively) such striking breaths of fresh air, but on no account should
        its ability to engage and entertain on those strengths of its own be underestimated.
        Taking a well-earned break from the surreal situations and the complex plotting,
        Kaufman turned his attention here to a much more straightforward yarn that
        was better grounded in reality; the twist there being that it was based on
        a story that, while allegedly true, just as likely never happened. \u0027Confessions\u0027
        though is willing to give Chuck Barris the benefit of the doubt in regards
        to his dubious claims to have been a secret assassin for the CIA in the midst
        of his days as a game show host, giving life to such controversial classic
        as \u0027the Gong Show\u0027 and \u0027the Dating Game\u0027 while taking
        it from a range of human targets around the globe. It sits back and lets the
        scenario unfold without question \u0096 and does so with such considerable
        spirit and vigour that it\u0027s hard not to get lured in and pulled along
        for the ride. Regardless of whether the real-life Barris truly did have some
        incredible adventures within his time, or simply an overly-active imagination,
        this movie translates it into one heck of an enjoyable romp \u0096 slick,
        stylish and entrancing on the surface, and with a bracingly poignant and sobering
        tale lurking underneath.\n\nKaufman continues to rule supreme with his flair
        for developing the most heavily flawed and eccentric of characters, investing
        them with witty dialogue and sharp situations and, as with his previous screenplays,
        the humour is a pleasantly mixed bag \u0096 lightly amusing at some points,
        laugh-out-loud hilarious at others, even outright alarming whenever it needs
        to be. George Clooney\u0027s direction, meanwhile, though it stands a fair
        distance from the eye-seizing zippiness that we\u0027re used to seeing Spike
        Jonze apply to this writer\u0027s workings, is still an accomplished visual
        take on the material, made sensational by its meticulous attention to detail.
        Indeed, the film\u0027s fondness for subtle in-jokes, crafty cameos (some
        great ones among the Dating Game contestants \u0096 absolutely great), background
        gags and general all-round intricacy is partly what makes it so rewarding
        and worthy of repeated viewings (I was watching it for what must have been
        sixth or seventh time last night, and still I found myself picking up a whole
        range of details that I somehow missed out on the first few times around).
        Sure, things can move a tad slowly every now and then, but with this number
        of niceties up there to be marvelled at you know you\u0027re never for a second
        going to be bored.\n\nIt also draws a fine contrast between the two separate
        pursuits that Chuck Barris is called to follow \u0096 the game show scenes
        are colourful, light-hearted fun, the assassin scenes murky and deliciously
        paranoid, and Sam Rockwell, at the helm as our savvy and hapless main man,
        has the timing, the energy and the appeal to emerge from the two as both a
        comic figure and a tragic one. Kicking off as a likable, familiar kind of
        anti-hero, whose goofy grin and offhand ways have us smiling through the bar
        fights and the womanising, he gradually evolves into something more enigmatic
        and sorrowful; a lost, confused individual whose more innocuous contributions
        to society, in the form of lowbrow \u0027trash TV\u0027, are widely scorned
        (not that I\u0027ve ever seen any of the genuine Chuck Barris\u0027s shows
        myself, but it would amaze me if they were really any worse than the kind
        of mind-numbing reality TV that\u0027s enjoyed popularity over the past few
        years), while the hidden talent he discovers in contract killing begins to
        understandably repulse him soon enough. One of the most effective things about
        \u0027Confessions\u0027 is just how deftly it uses its gags and its pathos,
        along with interview snippets from those who were acquainted with the real-life
        Barris, which punctuate the story at various points, to reflect upon this
        man, his life, and just how much he really achieved either way, arriving in
        the end at quite a biting conclusion. I don\u0027t think that any other rendition
        of \u0027If I had a Hammer\u0027 could feel nearly as sad and haunting as
        it does here.\n\nDrew Barrymore and Clooney himself offer nice support all
        the while, each epitomising different ends of the Chuck Barris spectrum \u0096
        Barrymore, as Chuck\u0027s bubbly girlfriend Penny, is a fun-loving innocent;
        Clooney, as his CIA director, is aptly subtle and mysterious. But neither
        of them, or anyone else involved for a matter of fact, comes even close to
        upstaging Rockwell, whose input is simply fantastic \u0096 there\u0027s no
        doubt in my mind that the Best Actor Award which, as the blurb on the DVD
        so proudly states, he picked up at the Berlin International Film Festival
        for his efforts, was well-and-truly earned.\n\nIt\u0027s not an innovative,
        far-out, one-of-a-kind experience (a la \u0027Being John Malkovich\u0027).
        But it\u0027s an entertaining, well-made and entirely satisfying flick with
        one particularly brilliant stand-out performance, and that\u0027s more than
        enough to do the job. Kaufman can probably pen avant-garde better than anybody
        else today, but \u0027Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\u0027 goes to prove
        that, when in the right company, he can write \u0027normal\u0027 just as impressively.\n\nGrade:

        if the creator and host of two of the 1970s biggest and lamest television
        game shows was also a part-time CIA hitman?  That he used The Dating Game

        Cold War espionage. Ridiculous you\u0027d say. But that\u0027s what exactly

        by Sam Rockwell as Barris, Julia Roberts as a fellow spy, Drew Barrymore as

        bizarre landscape, a marriage of television and espionage, is presented without

        of a Dangerous Mind: 8\/10","review_text":"\nGeorge Clooney\u0027s directorial
        debut is a compelling dramatic biopic about `Gong Show\u0027 host Chuck Barris,
        who claims to be a hit man for the CIA. Barris started out small, but decided
        to go for the big time and move to New York, where he got a job at NBC. Soon
        he becomes a manager type person, and creates an idea for a game show called
        `The Dating Game\u0027. It becomes a hit, but he feels unfulfilled, even though
        he has Penny (Drew Barrymore). Also, Jim Byrd (Clooney) from the CIA recruits
        Barris to kill for the CIA. As we watch the movie, we don\u0027t know which
        is true and which is a figment of his imagination. Think of it as an R-rated
        Beautiful Mind.\n\nBarris is played with great intensity by Sam Rockwell.
        Clooney took a risk of planting a not-well-known name as the lead. With such
        star power behind him like Clooney, Barrymore, and Julia Roberts, he stands
        out. Rockwell has starred in such movies before like Heist and The Green Mile,
        all three times with great acting. He brings out the inner demons of Barris.
        Rockwell was exceptional, and exceptionally believable. Even though he was
        billed fourth, he has his name out now and we can expect him in larger things.\n\nMany
        scenes were standout, with their camera angles and unique way of playing it.
        At times it seemed like a play, with a wall disappearing, for instance. However,
        Confessions of a Dangerous Mind wasn\u0027t as funny as I was hoping. Sure,
        some scenes were quite funny (like the scenes in the beginning where it was
        a montage of the f-word). It had an authentic feel to the 60\u0027s (including
        the soundtrack), like Catch Me If You Can did. At times, it had a documentary
        style to it, which would have been more effective if they had more substance
        behind it, such as more of the interviews or none at all. Many of the camera
        shots were close-ups, which looked quite cool. I am a game show aficionado,
        so I thought that most of the time would be spent on Barris going onto the
        CIA, but it was evenly divided between the two, so I was happy.\n\nAt times,
        the mood was light-hearted, almost satirical, but at other points it was serious
        drama that poked at your emotions. As I said before, Rockwell is definitely
        lead material. Clooney did a good job portraying the CIA recruiter, and Barrymore
        is the other standout as Barris\u0027 girlfriend. She and Rockwell, besides
        good chemistry, both displayed true emotions. Roberts, as another CIA agent,
        put in her usual mediocre performance, though she was better than normal.
        However, many characters have no substance behind them, namely Roberts, who
        was billed third and had about three scenes (which, I guess, is better than
        Jennifer Aniston in Office Space).\n\nPossible the only downpoint of the movie
        was that at times, it got too trippy for its own good. Even Barris didn\u0027t
        know what was real and what wasn\u0027t. It got a little too muddled in plot,
        such as who is who, at times. When Barris sees everyone who he killed, that
        was just\u0085weird. Anyway, I would highly recommend Confessions of a Dangerous
        Mind to about anyone.\n\nMy rating: 8\/10\n\nRated R for language, sexual
        content and violence.","date_written":"2003-01-26 00:00:00","date_written_unix":1043492400},{"username":"sixtwentysix","user_rating":8,"user_location":"Denver,

        The meat of this story is not so much in his occupations but the mental condition
